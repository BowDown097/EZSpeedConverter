# EZ Speed Converter
This program allows you to convert videos from NTSC speed to PAL speed and vice versa. When converting, you can choose to have the pitch be modified to fit the speed conversion or to not have the pitch be modified. You can also convert to your own speed.

Note that if you keep original pitch, the audio of the converted video may be distorted, depending on the degree you changed the speed.
